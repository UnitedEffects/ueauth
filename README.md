# UE Auth by United Effects, Inc.

[![Build](https://github.com/UnitedEffects/ueauth/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/UnitedEffects/ueauth/actions/workflows/build.yml)

[UE Auth](https://ueauth.com) is a **Patent Pending** multi-tenant OIDC / OAuth 2.0 provider and identity management platform that features (non-exhaustive):

- User management
- Organization management (e.g., customers, departments, groups, etc.)
- Product management
- Role & Fine-grained permissions by product (actions that can be taken agains highly specific elements of a product)
- B2B product access managed and mapped between customers, users, and products
- An interface to retrieve all access for a user through the OIDC token
- Plugin support for notifications, event streaming, transaction challenges (MFA, Device Login, etc.), and WebAuthN
- Magic link, social, and passwordless logins
- Federated SSO globally or by product supporting OIDC, OAuth, and SAML protocols

The project is intended to create a single hybrid solution to serve as identity and access for both self-registered B2C apps and enterprise B2B solutions. The feature set combines the functionality you find in traditional commercial auth providers for identity management from the last decade, but provides the missing pieces development organizations typically have to build on their own, all as one package that can be run as a container.
